## Description for the app

The API does not provide the ability to search and sort by breed, so I have implemented it myself in the frontend using a JavaScript functions called searchDogs and filterDogsByBreedFor for each page because the API does not exist for these functionalities.

## To run the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
