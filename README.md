# Dogs-breeds-explorer

The Dog Breeds Explorer is a web application built using React and JavaScript and using a Dog public API.
It allows users to search for images of specific dog breeds and view basic information about them.

I have implemented key features like search bar functionality and a sorting mechanism to organize dog breeds by group,
but the API does not provide the ability to search and sort by breed, so I have implemented it using a JavaScript function for each page because the API does not exist for these functionalities.

For starting the frontend application here are the steps:

1.Install the dependencies by running the following command:

### `npm install`

2.In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
